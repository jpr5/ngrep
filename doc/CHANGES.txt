v1.46.1

        o actual bugfix for the VLAN parsing issue.  prior version 1.46 expanded
          the BPF filter to include IPv4/6 traffic, but the offset calculation
          forgot to account for the variable presence of VLAN headers.  now
          ngrep detects VLAN frames in every packet and adjusts the offset on
          the fly.

v1.46

		o configure.in: re-organized, in part to sync with downstream patches
		  (which were never sent upstream)
   
        o configure.in: removed included PCRE library, now builds against system
          version when specified (default is included GNU Regex)

        o configure.in: fixed duplicate PCAP header check, which broke with the
          release of libpcap 1.0

        o configure.in: prefixed all tack-on autoconf variables from _FOO -> EXTRA_FOO

		o Makefile.in: capitulated to Debian: use tar.gz instead of tar.bz2 :-(

        o ngrep.c: Call setlocale to make isprint() work based on current
          locale.  See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=307496++

        o include tcpkill functionality (-K), a long-standing downstream patch
          under Debian
		
        o updated to latest autoconf
		
		o updated copyrights to 2014

v1.45

        o fixed bug where setting the snaplen smaller than the minimum
          necessary to read the full headres would cause garbage to be
          fed into the pattern matcher

        o fixed unreported bug in IPv6/TCP packet length calculation

        o relocated the privilege-dropping routine to be invoked right
          before entering the packet processing loop, to prevent
          interference with necessary permissions to read or write
          dumpfiles/etc.

        o fixed integer overflow with the snaplen that resulted from
          an implicit signed/unsigned conversion

        o minor change to compensate for some broken compiler
          optimizers

        o fixed double-free race condition during ngrep termination

        o reworked packet length calculation in the main processing
          loop, improving performance and readability

        o simplified regex build logic in configure and Makefile

        o updated Win32 version to use config.h for preprocessor
          definitions instead of the Visual Studio project files,
          making manual tweaking and config of ngrep for Win32
          consistent with *NIX and more obvious

        o changed third-party Makefiles to properly clean up after
          themselves

        o added support for radiotap (IEEE802_11_RADIO)

        o changed ``-s 0'' invocation to mimic the equivalent of tcpdump

v1.44
        o added post-config section to configure: emit important
          config option settings that weren't previously indicated

        o for BSD platforms, only emit pcap_restart warning from
          configure if ``--disable-pcap-restart'' hasn't been
          specified

        o added IPv6 and ICMPv6 support (all platforms); disabled by
          default for common case where libpcap wasn't compiled with
          IPv6 support

        o added support for displaying protocol number (``-N''),
          useful for when observing raw packets

        o added support for new display method ``single'', similar to
          ``byline'' but both header and data occupy one single line

        o introduced multiple levels of quiet (``-q''); the more it is
          specified the more quiet ngrep becomes

        o reorganization of some internal support headers and core
          code to eliminate redundancy, improve readability and
          efficiency, and support new features

        o changed all integer types to be bit- and sign-explicit

v1.43
        o healed the win32 code fork: ngrep now builds from the same
          source tree for all platforms including Windows

        o re-wrote the privilege revocation logic after problems were
          reported with the SPC version, and removed non-root
          drop_privs capability altogether

        o fix off-by-one bug which caused ngrep to exit 1 packet early
          when ``-A'' as invoked

        o Fixed problematic configtest for old broken-redhat-glibc UDP
          header

        o ngrep now sets a pcap filter "ip" by default, if one is not
          specified

        o header offset fix to 802.11 processing

        o support IGMP and Raw (unknown IP protocol) type packets

        o support for latest versions of libpcap (0.8.3) and winpcap
          (3.1 beta 4)

        o updated configure to autoconf 2.59, and config.guess and
          config.sub to latest versions

        o updated PCRE from 3.4 to 5.0

        o and various minor changes and updates to improve ngrep

v1.42
        o rewrote the entire configure.in/config.h.in to autoconf 2.57
          to be more consistent with normal autoconf'd programs.
          corrects bugs around packaging impediments and typos

        o improved privilege dropping code and added more options to
          configure to govern its behaviour

        o added flag to turn off privilege revocation logic

        o added multiline match as default and ability to enforce
          previous default single-line match (bugfix + feature)

        o added ability to read bpf filter expression from file

        o added ability to force the column width to a certain size

        o added two new output modes: ``byline'', whose output
          respects embedded carriage returns (useful for http dumps),
          and ``none'', which prints out each dump as a single line no
          matter what

        o added ability to specify alternate nonprintable character
          (default is ``.'')

        o made ``-q'' effects more consistent and usable for scenarios
          where ``-I'' and/or ``-O'' are being employed

        o documentation updated

v1.41
        o added -S (set limitlen)
        o added LOOP and SLL tests for portability/old libpcap'en
        o added configure --safe-user and dropprivs code
        o added TCP ECN congestion header recognition
        o improved support for a few OSes
        o relaxed some restrictions in the license (COPYRIGHT -> LICENSE)
        o 802.11 support

v1.40.1
        o MacOS X support
        o ISDN (SLL) support
        o OpenBSD tun device support
        o updated configure.in to support specifying pcap directory
        o updated config.sub and config.guess
        o added scripts/multi.pl, parallel ngrep perl script
        o very minor change to documentation

v1.40
        o license change, amends the BSD advertising clause
        o fixed bug from not considering caplen in payload length
          calculations
        o added -s (set bpf caplen)
        o fixed header include for linux glibc 2.2 (time.h wasn't
          being included)

v1.39.2
        o typographical error, -p works now

v1.39.1
        o added in AIX includes
        o added BSD* includes for display updates
        o added -p (don't go into promiscuous mode)

v1.39
        o in standard match mode, the display now updates when window
          sizes change
        o configure now gives the user the option to compile with the
          pcre library, which is more license-friendly (albeit slower)
        o fixed minor bug in date printing with -t
        o added configure option '--without-restart', which will
          remove the pcap restart API call.  Newer versions of libpcap
          don't need it, and on certain platforms the API call
          segfaults
        o win32: compiled with winpcap's pcap.h, which apparently
          breaks the pcap standard and introduces its own data link
          layer types.  fixes the 'unsupported interface' error folks
          sometimes got when used with a 100bT adapter

v1.38
        o binary matching
        o windows compilation support
        o 64-bit clean patch to regex.c
        o dump and replay pcap_dump files

        o normal and diff/delta timestamps

v1.37
        o added FDDI support

v1.36
        o added -l (line buffer stdout)
        o a few optimizations were made to shave off some cpu cycles
          spent on processing each packet
        o fixed bug where the blank regex algorithm wasn't even being
          used
        o fixed bug in blank regex algorithm that was preventing '-n'
          from working
        o change to compile on LinuxPPC
        o change to nix potential warnings on other OSes
        o change to not exit if pcap_lookupnet fails

v1.35
        o appears that the release of 1.34 had only one of the
          match optimizations: somehow only the tcp match was updated;
          udp change was omitted.  fixed
        o moved -v (version) to -V
        o added -v (grep -v), invert match
        o added -d lo (null linktype)
        o added ability to match proto icmp
        o updated configure.in to handle old installations of pcap
          more gracefully (i.e. continue on by adding the necessary
          defines and just gripe)

v1.34
        o merged in patch from Andrew W. Flury <aflury@nas.nasa.gov>
          for hex printing, made minor modification to patch to not
          print off the end of the buffer
        o added an optimization for the case where no regex was
          specified; should account for a little speed up

v1.33
        o fragment changes, this should be it

v1.32
        o switched around regex -w/-i logic
        o fragment bugfixes

v1.31
        o added -A (match after)
        o Makefile.in changes
        o configure.in changes for solaris
        o added manpage (ngrep.8)

v1.30

        o bugfix: wasn't malloc'ing enough for word_regex
        o bugfix: case-insensitive was tolower()ing the word_regex
          itself

v1.29

        o added -e (show empty)
        o one or two safe, preemptive changes catching possible int
          overflows

v1.28

        o added -n
        o no required arguments anymore
        o regex's are not required anymore, can just be bpf logic
        o probably a bugfix or two
